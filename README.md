# Pinaka (v0.1)

An experimental Android project exploring voice-based control and background services.

## Current Status (v0.1)
- App launch and core service setup
- Basic voice input handling
- Call-related command triggers
- Permission handling for microphone access

## Known Issues
- Microphone stability affected by Android security restrictions
- Background voice services are not fully reliable yet

## Planned Improvements (v0.2)
- Message-based actions via voice commands
- Improved background microphone handling
- Reduced crashes and better command accuracy

## Long-Term Goal
To develop a secure voice-controlled system where actions are performed only by the authorized user, using voice recognition and/or additional authentication.

## Note
This project is under active development.
Still learning, experimenting, and improving.
